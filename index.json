The success rate of BMD alone in estimating the risk of vertebral fragility fracture (VFF) is approximately 50%, making BMD far from ideal in predicting VFF. In addition, whether or not a patient has been diagnosed with osteoporosis or osteopenia, he or she may suffer a VFF. For this reason, we conducted an extensive empirical study to assess VFFs in postmenopausal women. We considered a representative dataset of 94 T1- and T2-weighted routine spine MRI (with osteopenia or osteoporosis), split into 2,400 samples (slices). Comparing the classification results of machine learning and deep learning (DL) techniques showed that DL generally achieved better results at the cost of higher computational power and hard explainability. ResNet achieved the best results in discriminating patients from groups with and without VFFs with 83% accuracy and 90% AUC (with a confidence interval of 99%). Our results represent a significant step toward prospective and longitudinal studies investigating methods to achieve higher accuracy in predicting VFFs based on spine MRI features of vertebrae without fracture.","tags":[],"title":"Analysis of vertebrae without fracture on spine MRI to assess bone fragility: A Comparison of Traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erikson J Aguiar","Alyson J Dos Santos","Rodolfo I Meneguette","Robson De Grade","Jó Ueyama"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1650564346,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650564346,"objectID":"54db2282b8c1a060bf5e6b65115ed406","permalink":"https://eriksonjaguiar.github.io/erikson.github.io/publication/fgcs-journal-2022/","publishdate":"2023-05-27T15:05:46-03:00","relpermalink":"/erikson.github.io/publication/fgcs-journal-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Modern healthcare systems are complex and regularly share sensitive data among multiple stakeholders, such as doctors, patients, and pharmacists. Patients’ data has increased and requires safe methods for its management. Research works related to blockchain, such as MIT MedRec, have strived to draft trustworthy and immutable systems to share data. However, blockchain may be challenging in healthcare scenarios due to issues about privacy and control of data sharing destinations. This paper presents a protocol for tracking shared medical data, which includes images, and controlling the medical data access by multiple conflicting stakeholders. Several efforts rely on blockchain for healthcare, but just a few are concerned about malicious data leakage in blockchain-based healthcare systems. We implement a token mechanism stored in DICOM files and managed by Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain. Our findings and evaluations revealed low chances of a hash collision, such as employing a fitting-resistance birthday attack.

Several researchers in different fields have attempted to develop methods to early identifying it and mitigating its effects. The Deep Learning (DL) approach, such as the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has been increasingly used in COVID-19 diagnoses. These models intend to support decision-making and are doing well to detecting patient status early. Although DL models have good accuracy to support diagnosis, they are vulnerable to Adversarial Attacks. These attacks are new methods to make DL models biased by adding small perturbations on the original image. This paper investigates the impact of Adversarial Attacks on DL models for classifying X-ray images of COVID-19 cases. We focused on the attack Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), which aims to add perturbations to the testing images by combining a perturbation matrix, producing a crafted image. We conduct the experiments analyzing the model’s performance attack-free and adding attacks. The following CNNs models were selected: DenseNet201, ResNet-50V2, MobileNetV2, NasNet and VGG16. In the attack-free environment, we reach precision around 99%. When it adds the attack, our results revealed that all models suffer from performance reduction, and the most affected was MobileNet that reduced its ability from 98.61% to 67.73%. However, the VGG16 network showed to be the least affected by the attacks. Our finds describe that DL models for COVID-19 are vulnerable to Adversarial Examples. The FGSM was capable of fooling the model, resulting in a significant reduction in the DL performance.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluation of the impact of physical adversarial attacks on deep learning models for classifying covid cases","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Principal Investigator:\tAgma Juci Machado Traina Grantee:\tErikson Júlio de Aguiar\nWith the advent of big data, data is being produced and generated on a large scale, used by Machine Learning (ML) models to generate new knowledge. Several areas have benefited from big data and ML, one of them being healthcare, which can employ complex data such as images to assist medical experts in decision making. While these concepts are valuable for healthcare, they can lead to issues regarding patient privacy and security. Information leaks in healthcare systems frequently. For example, in 2020, data of 200,000 patients from public health systems in Brazil was exposed. The ML models employed in healthcare are susceptible to attacks that poison the input data, the model itself and cause problems in the test data. In addition, they can present both known and unknown backdoors. The area of study that proposes defense and attack strategies against ML models is adversarial machine learning, which aims to reduce the model’s reliability and cause the model to misclassify the data. Therefore, this project aims to devise a framework consisting of defense, vulnerability exploitation, and attack models to understand and combat security and privacy violations in pattern recognition models in medical images. Medical images are used as input to ML models to recognize patterns and support medical decision-making. However, these images, such as the models that classify them, can suffer attacks to invalidate their robustness or compromise the patient’s privacy. In this project, we hope to: (I) develop defensive algorithms against adversarial examples; (II) devise methods to preserve patient privacy; (III) exploit new vulnerabilities and backdoors that ML models may present; (IV) propose attack strategies and their respective defenses, to communicate to other researchers the possible paths an attacker may follow.\n","date":1646092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646092800,"objectID":"98139937e8de3ddcd821fd942ed444f1","permalink":"https://eriksonjaguiar.github.io/erikson.github.io/project/fapesp-doutorado/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/erikson.github.io/project/fapesp-doutorado/","section":"project","summary":"This project was financed by Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) as Dotoracte Scholarship in Brazil (grant \\#21/08982-3) from  Mach 01, 2022, to now.","tags":null,"title":"Security and privacy in machine learning models to medical images against adversarial attacks","type":"project"},{"authors":["Erikson Aguiar","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

However, healthcare records that contain confidential patient data make this system very complicated because there is a risk of a privacy breach. This study aims to address research into the applications of the blockchain healthcare area. It sets out by discussing the management of medical information, as well as the sharing of medical records, image sharing, and log management. We also discuss papers that intersect with other areas, such as the Internet of Things, the management of information, tracking of drugs along their supply chain, and aspects of security and privacy. As we are aware that there are other surveys of blockchain in healthcare, we analyze and compare both the positive and negative aspects of their papers. Finally, we seek to examine the concepts of blockchain in the medical area, by assessing their benefits and drawbacks and thus giving guidance to other researchers in the area.

No Brasil, as pesquisas sobre Análise de Sentimento ainda estão se estabelecendo. Com base nesse contexto, este trabalho propõe um método para estimar sentimentos em redes sociais para a língua portuguesa, tendo como foco o Twitter. Para tal, é utilizado um Comitê, que é implementado por meio de um conjunto de algoritmos de aprendizagem de máquina para classiﬁcação. A avaliação do método proposto foi realizada utilizando testes estatísticos e de desempenho. Os resultados obtidos indicam que o Comitê teve melhor acurácia se comparado a outros algoritmos de aprendizagem de máquina para os testes de desempenho. Contudo, não foi comprovada diferença estatística entre o Comitê e alguns dos algoritmos, o que pode indicar que estes métodos podem alcançar acurácia equivalente ao Comitê em algumas situações especíﬁcas, como por exemplo, uma base de dados maior.
