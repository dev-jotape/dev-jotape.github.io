&lt;p>With the advent of big data, data is being produced and generated on a large scale, used by Machine Learning (ML) models to generate new knowledge. Several areas have benefited from big data and ML, one of them being healthcare, which can employ complex data such as images to assist medical experts in decision making. While these concepts are valuable for healthcare, they can lead to issues regarding patient privacy and security. Information leaks in healthcare systems frequently. For example, in 2020, data of 200,000 patients from public health systems in Brazil was exposed. The ML models employed in healthcare are susceptible to attacks that poison the input data, the model itself and cause problems in the test data. In addition, they can present both known and unknown backdoors. The area of study that proposes defense and attack strategies against ML models is adversarial machine learning, which aims to reduce the model&amp;rsquo;s reliability and cause the model to misclassify the data. Therefore, this project aims to devise a framework consisting of defense, vulnerability exploitation, and attack models to understand and combat security and privacy violations in pattern recognition models in medical images. Medical images are used as input to ML models to recognize patterns and support medical decision-making. However, these images, such as the models that classify them, can suffer attacks to invalidate their robustness or compromise the patient&amp;rsquo;s privacy. In this project, we hope to: (I) develop defensive algorithms against adversarial examples; (II) devise methods to preserve patient privacy; (III) exploit new vulnerabilities and backdoors that ML models may present; (IV) propose attack strategies and their respective defenses, to communicate to other researchers the possible paths an attacker may follow.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A trust protocol with multiple levels of access -- case study with blockchain in medical applications</title><link>https://eriksonjaguiar.github.io/erikson.github.io/project/fapesp-mestrado/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eriksonjaguiar.github.io/erikson.github.io/project/fapesp-mestrado/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Principal Investigator:&lt;/strong> Jó Ueyama

&lt;p>The Blockchain technology has been gaining visibility in the market and the academic environment, due to its characteristics that allow to boost the security and reliability and robustness of distributed systems. Several areas are being considered with advances in research using this technology, such as: (i) finance, (ii) environment sensing, (iii) data analysis, and (iv) health. It is possible to emphasize that the characteristics of data immutability, privacy, transparency, decentralization and distributed ledger all contribute significantly to Blockchain being applicable by solutions in several areas. In this sense, it is highlighted that one of the contexts that can benefit from this approach is the sharing of medical records for research purposes. This type of information contains confidential patient data, which makes this sharing process more complex because of the risks of privacy breach. From this perspective, this research project has as main aim to propose a Blockchain based protocol of multiple levels of access, that is safe and manageable for the sharing of medical images. In addition, such a proposal should provide the institutions (medical and research) of your network the ability to track and audit the shared data. In brief, this project proposal aims to contribute with advances in multidisciplinary areas by proposing and evaluating a protocol that is able to facilitate the intersection of information between the medical and computer areas.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
