I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics at University of São Paulo (USP). With a solid foundation in software development, I have accumulated 7 years of experience focusing on backend applications using javascript/typescript.
Since I started my master's degree, I have dedicated my research to Remote Sensing, specifically exploring the utilization of deep learning models to predict socioeconomic indicators from satellite imagery.
