The Blockchain technology has been gaining visibility in the market and the academic environment, due to its characteristics that allow to boost the security and reliability and robustness of distributed systems. Several areas are being considered with advances in research using this technology, such as: (i) finance, (ii) environment sensing, (iii) data analysis, and (iv) health. It is possible to emphasize that the characteristics of data immutability, privacy, transparency, decentralization and distributed ledger all contribute significantly to Blockchain being applicable by solutions in several areas. In this sense, it is highlighted that one of the contexts that can benefit from this approach is the sharing of medical records for research purposes. This type of information contains confidential patient data, which makes this sharing process more complex because of the risks of privacy breach. From this perspective, this research project has as main aim to propose a Blockchain based protocol of multiple levels of access, that is safe and manageable for the sharing of medical images. In addition, such a proposal should provide the institutions (medical and research) of your network the ability to track and audit the shared data. In brief, this project proposal aims to contribute with advances in multidisciplinary areas by proposing and evaluating a protocol that is able to facilitate the intersection of information between the medical and computer areas.
